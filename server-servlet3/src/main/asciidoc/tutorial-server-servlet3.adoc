== The Servlet 3 server application

The server application is basically a simple Servlet 3 application exposing one messaging destination.

The necessary configuration for GraniteDS is very simple and consists in adding an annotated configuration class to
trigger the startup of GraniteDS (using a Servlet 3 container initializer behind the scenes):

[[server.destination]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/chat/server/ChatApplication.java
----
include::{srcdir}/main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/chat/server/ChatApplication.java[tags=server-filter]
----
<1> The +ServerFilter+ annotation triggers GraniteDS initialization.
<2> The property +chatTopic+ annotated with +MessagingDestination+ indicates that we want to setup a messaging destination
with the name of the property. See the client usage <<client.destination,here>>.
